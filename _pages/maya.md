      "### Location

      Menlo Park

      ### Disciplines / Categories

      Road 4, Cyclocross 4

      ### Favorite Pre-Race Fuel

      Big ol' bowl of oatmeal

      ### Favorite Route

      I don't want to pick favorites, but the classic coast route is rad: going up OLH and down 84 to Pescadero, then up Tunitas, and finally down Kings Mountain. I love any ride with Kings and lots of descending.

      ### Favorite Post-Race Meal

      Burritos"
