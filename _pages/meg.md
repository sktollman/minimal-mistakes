      ### Other Info

      Had to move to Cali (fiancé in Coast Guard) and the cycling community is HUGE!! I’ve made so many close friends that I’ll stay connected with forever! After racing Triathlon for 6 years it felt so great to be part of a team and joining Razzle Dazzle in 2018 was the best way to get into the road racing scene. Thank you all for being so welcoming and teaching me some pack racing tips! "
