## About Us

Razzle Dazzle is a women’s elite development bicycle racing team formed in 2015 to promote cycling and compete in one of the most competitive regions in the country. We are a USA Cycling sanctioned team based in the San Francisco Bay Area, registered in the Northern California and Nevada Cycling Association (NCNCA) region. Our mission is to support the development of elite racers and promote progress through teamwork and partnerships. We’re ambassadors of the sport and we engage with local organizations through volunteer and charity work to support our community.

## What is "Razzle Dazzle?"

The name might bring sparkles and sequins to mind, but razzle dazzle camouflage was used on ships and planes in WWI and WWII. It consists of a paint scheme of different geometric shapes and colors randomly intersecting one another. The purpose was not to hide the ships and planes, but to make it difficult to estimate the distance, direction, and speed of that target.
